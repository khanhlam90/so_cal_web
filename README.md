## Description
The SoCal Tanzanian Community is a group of people from Tanzania living in Southern California consciously collaborating on the basis of their belonging to the same country of origin. Collaboration could be through meetings and social events. SoCal Tanzanian community (Entity Number: C4564114) is a registered nonprofit membership organization, based in Southern California. Members are the heartbeat of the SoCal Tanzanian Community. The agreement of the Southern California Tanzanian Community entered by and between the SoCal and its members effective as of February 07-2020. Whereas the members formed the SoCal as a nonprofit Mutual benefit corporation under the laws of California.

This application is built because as a Non-Profit Organization, it is essential that the SoCal Tanzanian Community has a centralized place, such as a website, which gives member access to community resources. Some of the resources include: membership registration, external resource links, and an event calendar.
